# Project Wallflower
Project Wallflower is a chat software that encrypts communications
using a one time pad, which is provably secure, and unbreakable.
This software will remain secure as long as the crpyto.pad file is
kept safe. ONLY TRANSFER THE CRYPTO.PAD FILE OFFLINE, AND TO PEOPLE
YOU WANT TO CHAT WITH.

This software includes a cryptographically secure random number
generator, and connects to a Canadian server by default.

To run simply get a copy of crypto_random.py, PadGen.py, and Wallflower_Client.py; run
the PadGen.py program in a Linux terminal and distribute the generated file to
everyone you want to chat with. Then chat by running the Wallflower_Client.py
software in the same directory as the crypto.pad file generated using PadGen.py.

You will be dropped into a room unique to your one-time pad.

I wil improve on the documentation as time goes on, but this version is
really just for people who want to get a sneak peak.
